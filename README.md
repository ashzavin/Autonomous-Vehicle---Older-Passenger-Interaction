# Autonomous-Vehicle--Passenger-Interfaces
We implemented a total of five scenes in the Unity 3D game engine for this project. If we map a passengerâ€™s journey in an AV, there can be three stages- 1) entering the vehicle, 2) engagement while driving, and 3) exiting the vehicle after arriving at the destination. For our evaluation, we implemented a total of five sequential scenarios where the first one simulates the interaction while entering the vehicle, the middle three scenarios demonstrate different interactions after riding inside the vehicle in three driving conditions (regular traffic, heavy traffic, and extreme weather), and the last one presents the scene related to the destination arrival. C# programming language has been used to control different objects of the unity scenes.
